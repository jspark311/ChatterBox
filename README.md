A demo of the Audeme MOVI shield driver re-write on top of ESP-IDF and CppPotpourri.

----------------------

## ESP32 support

The following three repositories must be pulled into the `components` folder. See the `downloadDeps.sh` script to see what exactly is required (or run it).

  * This project depends on [ManuvrPlatforms/ESP32](https://github.com/jspark311/ManuvrPlatforms/ESP32) to provide the fill-in for AbstractPlatform as appropriate for the ESP32.
  * This project depends on [ManuvrDrivers](https://github.com/jspark311/ManuvrDrivers) to support most of the hardware.
  * This project depends on [CppPotpourri](https://github.com/jspark311/CppPotpourri) to glue all that stuff together.


This project was written against Espressif's ESP-IDF libraries and build environment (idf5.3). So you'll need that if you want to build and flash onto hardware. Other versions will likely work, but YMMV. Blame ManuvrPlatforms.


### Building

The `activate.sh` script contains the commands I use for shell setup to use ESP-IDF...

```
#esp-idf v5.3
source ~/esp-idf/export.sh
```

...and the command to build and flash the firmware...

```
idf.py build size
idf.py flash monitor
```

### Usage

Using the `idf.py monitor` command will give you a nice color console with ESP-IDF's logging. But
`ParsingConsole` can be configured as desired, and used by any serial terminal program.
